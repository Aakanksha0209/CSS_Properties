# Getting Started with Cascading Style Sheets

This project was made with the use of HTML Tags & CSS Properties.

## CSS Properties Used:

We have used external Cascading Style Sheet as well as inline so as to get a complete overview on how CSS works and how each property affects the component in a different way.

In the project directory, you can find :

 `Background Color`</br> - Helps choose a background colour of your choice (Format: RGB, HEX).</br></br>
 `Font Family`</br> - Allows to choose from a variet of fonts(Arial, Times new Roman, Monospace and many more).</br></br>
 `Font Size`</br> - Control the size of each text.</br></br>
 `Padding`</br> - Gives specified amount of space.</br></br>
 `Border Styles`</br> - Helps apply various borders (Solid, dotted, dashes).</br></br>
 `Text Alignments`</br> - Helps align texts (Center, Left, Right).</br></br>
